# Course Summary: Advanced Graph Searches and Multi-Agent Games

## Course Overview
This course covered advanced topics in graph theory, multi-agent games, and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). It provided an in-depth understanding of various graph search algorithms, game theory strategies, and decision-making processes in uncertain environments.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Advanced Graph Searches
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, exploring all neighbor nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting at the root and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **A***: A graph traversal and path search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using heuristics to improve efficiency.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: An algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.

### 2. Multi-Agent Games
- **Minimax Algorithm**: A decision rule for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"—to maximize the minimum gain.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization technique for the minimax algorithm that eliminates branches in the search tree which do not influence the final decision.
- **Nash Equilibrium**: A solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players, where no player can gain by changing strategies if the other players keep their strategies unchanged.
- **Zero-Sum Games**: A situation in multi-agent games where one participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participants.

### 3. Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
- **MDP Framework**: A mathematical process that describes an environment in decision making, consisting of states, actions, transition models, and rewards.
- **Value Iteration**: An algorithm that computes the optimal policy and the value of each state by iteratively improving the value estimates.
- **Policy Iteration**: An algorithm that involves two steps—policy evaluation and policy improvement—to find the optimal policy.
- **Bellman Equation**: A recursive equation used to calculate the value function, central to dynamic programming approaches in MDPs.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: A type of machine learning technique where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards.

## Learning Outcomes
